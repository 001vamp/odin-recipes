    <h2>Directions for Homemade Fries:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. </strong>(A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.)</li>
        <li><strong>Soak them cold in water</strong> for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries.)</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse them twice</strong> with cold water and pat the completely dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat oil to 300 degrees.</strong> Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.</li>
        <li><strong> Increase heat to 400 degrees.</strong> Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Place them on paper towels</strong> and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup! </li>
    </ol>
